Characters

Characters are (by default) Objects setup to be puppeted by Accounts.
They are what you "see" in game. The Character class in this module
is setup to be the "default" character type created by the default
creation commands.

class Character(ObjectParent, DefaultCharacter):
    """
    The Character defaults to reimplementing some of base Object's hook methods with the
    following functionality:

    at_basetype_setup - always assigns the DefaultCmdSet to this object type
                    (important!)sets locks so character cannot be picked up
                    and its commands only be called by itself, not anyone else.
                    (to change things, use at_object_creation() instead).
    at_post_move(source_location) - Launches the "look" command after every move.
    at_post_unpuppet(account) -  when Account disconnects from the Character, we
                    store the current location in the pre_logout_location Attribute and
                    move it to a None-location so the "unpuppeted" character
                    object does not need to stay on grid. Echoes "Account has disconnected"
                    to the room.
    at_pre_puppet - Just before Account re-connects, retrieves the character's
                    pre_logout_location Attribute and move it back on the grid.
    at_post_puppet - Echoes "AccountName has entered the game" to the room.

        Displays the name of the object in a viewer-aware manner.

        Args:
            looker (TypedObject): The object or account that is looking
                at/getting inforamtion for this object. If not given, `.name` will be
                returned, which can in turn be used to display colored data.

        Returns:
            str: A name to display for this object. This can contain color codes and may
                be customized based on `looker`. By default this contains the `.key` of the object,
                followed by the DBREF if this user is privileged to control said object.

        Notes:
            This function could be extended to change how object names appear to users in character,
            but be wary. This function does not change an object's keys or aliases when searching,
            and is expected to produce something useful for builders.
